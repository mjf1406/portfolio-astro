Make no mistake that this technology is revolutionary, but also make no mistake to consider it intelligent, for there is no reasoning capability, nor does any LLM actually understand what its output truly means. That is not to say that LLMs cannot produce anything original, nor does it go so far to say that they can't be used to produce anything original.
